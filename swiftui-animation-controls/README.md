# swiftui-animation-controls

`swiftui-animation-controls` is a wrapper around some of the example animation controls. By using `swiftui-animation-controls` you can use these basic controls directly in your program with just a few lines of code, including the animation part of course. Of course, this swift package is still in the preliminary development stage, and please note that some sample animations (such as apple music scrolling lyrics animation controls, etc.) will not be included. If you want to use this function, you should read the source code to find the direction. The development cycle of the project depends on the situation.
